1 - NORMALIZATION:

RM = {StudID, CourseID, StudName, CourseName, Grade, FacName, FacPhone}

FDs:

StudID -> StudName (OK)
StudID, CourseID -> Grade (OK)
CourseID -> CourseName (OK)
CourseID -> FacName (OK)
FacName -> FacPhone (OK)


(1) 1NF:
	Each attribute must be atomic?
	Multi-values = CourseID, CourseName, Grade, FacName, FacPhone


|StudID |CourseID        |StudName |CourseName       |Grade  | FacName         |FacPhone
|-------|--------------  |-----    |-----            |-----  |-----            |-----
| 1     | PROG2          | Adams   | Prog2           | 1     | Dhungana        | 1234
| 1     | DBSE2UE        | Adams   | Database        | 2     | Gambi           | 1122
| 2     | PROG2          | Jones   | Prog2           | 3     | Dhungana        | 1234

(2) 2NF:
		- 1NF (Each attribute must be atomic)
		- All non-key attributes are fully functional dependent (FFD) on the primary key (PK)
			- No partial dependency between prime attributes and non-key
			- Note: if the PK is atomic, the relation is automatically in 2NF

Candidate Keys:
					Key: {StudID, CourseID}
					Key is not atomic

					To define StudName we need StudID but NOT CourseID; thus, StudName is NOT FFD on PK

					To define CourseName we need CourseID but NOT StudID; thus, CourseName is NOT FFD on PK
					To define FacName we need CourseID but NOT StudID; thus, FacName is NOT FFD on PK
					To define FacPhone we need CourseID but NOT StudID; thus, FacPhone is NOT FFD on PK

					To define Grade we need StudID AND CourseID; thus, Grade is FFD on PK


|StudID |CourseID        |StudName |CourseName       |Grade  | FacName         |FacPhone
|-------|--------------  |-----    |-----            |-----  |-----            |-----
| 1     | PROG2          | Adams   | Prog2           | 1     | Dhungana        | 1234
| 1     | DBSE2UE        | Adams   | Database        | 2     | Gambi           | 1122
| 2     | PROG2          | Jones   | Prog2           | 3     | Dhungana        | 1234
| 3     | PROG2          | Smith   | Prog2           | 1     | Dhungana        | 1234
| 4     | PROG2          | Baker   | Prog2           | 3     | Dhungana        | 1234

To make it in 2NF decompose R into smaller tables/relations

Table1: 
	PKey: {StudID} 

	|StudID |StudName 
	|-------|-----    
	| 1		| Adams   
	
Is this in 2NF?
	Yes: because PK is atomic

Table 2:
	PKey: {CourseID}
	
	|CourseID        |CourseName | FacName         |FacPhone
	|--------------  |
	| PROG2          | Prog2     | Dhungana        | 1234
	| DBSE2UE        | Database  | Gambi           | 1122     

Is this in 2NF?
	Yes: because PK is atomic

Table 3:
	Pkey: {StudID, CourseID}

	|StudID |CourseID  | Grade
	|-------|----------|-----
	| 1     | PROG2    | 1
	| 1     | DBSE2UE  | 2

Is this in 2NF?
	Yes, because Grade is FFD on PK



(3) 3NF:
		- 2NF
		- No transitive dependency for non-key attributes (so FD between non-key attributes)

Table1: Student
	PKey: {StudID} 

	| StudID | StudName 
	|--------|-----    
	| 1      | Adams   
	| 2      | Jones
	| 3      | Smith
	| 4      | Baker

Only StudName is non-key attributes

Is this 3NF?
	Yes, there's only one non-key attribute, therefore, there cannot be any deps between non-key attributes

Table 2: (Removed and replaced with 4, 5, 6)
	PKey: {CourseID}
	
	|CourseID        |CourseName | FacName         |FacPhone
	|----------------|-----------|-----------------|--------
	| PROG2          | Prog2     | Dhungana        | 1234
	| DBSE2UE        | Database  | Gambi           | 1122

CourseName, FacName, and FacPhone are non-key attributes

Is this 3NF?
	No, there is the FD: FacName -> FacPhone

TO make this 3NF we need to decompose the table:

Table 4: Course

	PKey:{CourseID}

 	|CourseID        |CourseName 
	|----------------|-----------
	| PROG2          | Prog2     
	| DBSE2UE        | Database  


Table 5: Lecturer/Faculty
	PKey: {FacName}

	| FacName         |FacPhone   
	|-----------------|-----------
	| Dhungana        | 1234		 
	| Gambi           | 1122


Table 6: Teaches
	PKey:{CourseID, FacName}

	|CourseID        | FacName
	|----------------|-----------
	| PROG2          | Dhungana     
	| DBSE2UE        | Gambi  


Table 3: Passed
	Pkey: {StudID, CourseID}

	|StudID |CourseID  | Grade
	|-------|----------|-----
	| 1     | PROG2    | 1
	| 1     | DBSE2UE  | 2

Only Grade is non-key attribute

Is this 3NF?
	Yes, there's only one non-key attribute, therefore, there cannot be any deps between non-key attributes



2 - TRANSACTIONS:


docker run --name mariadbtest -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mypass -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb:latest

In one terminal run: docker exec -it mariadbtest mariadb --user root -pmypass

In a second terminal run: docker exec -it mariadbtest mariadb --user root -pmypass

Now you have established two different connections (concurrent connections) to the same database and 
can play around with transactions by interleaving their atomic commands.

To switch autocommit off:
SET autocommit = 0

To switch autocommit on:
SET autocommit = 1


Some commands that we used:

MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;

MariaDB [(none)]> create database session08;

MariaDB [(none)]> connect session08;

MariaDB [session08]> show tables;

MariaDB [session08]> CREATE TABLE myTest(x INT);

MariaDB [session08]> SELECT * FROM myTest;
