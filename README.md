# DBSTUE SS23

This is the repository for your playground, exercises, and homework for Database Systems 2023

# Session 03: 22/03/2023

### Setup

- create a folder `session3`
- inside the `session3` folder create the `session3.py` module
- inside the `session3` folder create a `tests` folder
- inside the `session3\tests` folder create `test_session3.py` and a `conftest.py`

>> NOTE: `conftest.py` enables you to share fixtures across tests. It is loaded automatically by `pytest`, and any fixtures defined in it are available to test modules in the **same directory and below** automatically. 

- the "production database" must be stored under `session3` and is called `session3.db`


## Exercise 1: Create a Database for the University Example

- Given the University ER Model presented in class briefly describes what entities and relations it contains

- Design a Relational Model from the ER Model. Limit yourself to represent all the entities (Professor, Assistant, Student, Lecture) and the following relationships:
    -   workFor
    -   hold
    -   attend 
    -   require

>> NOTE: think on how you could/should deal with the different cardinalities

- Implement the Relational Model into Sqlite

- Fill it with some test data (using python code!)


## Exercise 2: Create Test Fixtures for the Database

- Refactor you code to improve testability
    - for instance, you can store queries into variables

- Implement the following test fixtures that return a connection to a sqlite database:

    - connection_to_empty_db: creates a test database with schema from Exercise 1 using a temporary file 
        
    - connection_to_fresh_test_db: creates a test database with schema from Exercise 1 filled with test data (from exercise 1) using a temporary file. The data must be inserted using queries.
    
    - connection_to_stored_test_db: creates a test database with schema from Exercise 1 filled with test data (from exercise 1) by copying an existing test database into a temporary file

- Write tests that check constraints of the implemented relations (e.g., cardinality). Test both positive and negative cases (asserting that Exceptions are raised during tests execution)

## Exercise 3: Extend the database

- Extend the ER model to include the concept of Tutor. Tutors are students that work for the faculty, thus are employees, and are assigned to a lecture. A lecture can have only one tutor, but the same tutor can be tutoring up to 3 lectures.

- Update the Relational Model to include the new changes in the ER Model

- Implement the new Relational Model by extending the code

- Fix the broken tests/fixtures

- Implement tests that check the new relations


# Session 02: 15/03/2023

## Exercise 1: Play around with sqlite (2)

- Complete the Exercise 2 from the previous lecture (install sqlite, write code to create a database, write a code to connect to a database)

- create a folder `session2`
 
- inside the `session2` folder create a module `test_session2.py`

- inside the `test_session2.py` module write a test that
    1. creates a database `test-db.db`
    2. table `Professor` with attributes `PersNr` (int), `FirstName` (string/varchar), and `LastName` (string/varchar) 
    3. insert the professor (123, Foo, Bar)
    4. insert the same professor (123, Foo, Bar) again
    5. assert that the second query fail

    Can you make the test fail?

- Fix the previous test to make the assertion fail (hint, define a PRIMARY KEY)

- write another test that
    1. connect to `test-db.db`
    2. create a second professor (234, Donald, Duck)
    3. check that the `Professor` contains two entries one for (123, Foo, Bar) and one for (234, Donald, Duck). Note the order does not matter

    What's the issue with those test cases?

## Exercise 2: Get you testing environment right

- Read about Xunit style of tests [https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/how-to/xunit_setup.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/how-to/xunit_setup.html)

- Update the `test_session2.py` module and implement a setup and a teardown. The test setup ensures that the database and the table exists, the teardown module ensures that the database is removed afterwards

- execute the two tests and verify that now the second test (checking the two entries) fail

- fix the second test case to make it pass. Discuss how

- Read about Pytest Fixtures [https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html)

- Read about TempFiles/Folders [https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/how-to/tmp_path.html](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/how-to/tmp_path.html)

- replace the setup and teardown methods with a fixture that initialize the database using a temporary file and fills

## Exercise 3: Understand ER Model

- Given the University ER Model presented in class briefly describes what entities and relations it contains

- Think of how you could implement this model into a database. (Do not implement it... just think about possible mapping between those entities and tables)


# Session 01: 08/03/2023

## Exercise 1: Setup Your Environment

- Checkout this repo
- Check if there are already registered Git submodules
- **Initialize** the git submodule for the public repository
- Create a folder `exercise.01`
- Inside the `exercise.01` folder, create a python virtual environment called `.venv`
- Activate `.venv` and install pytest, pymock, pycoverage
- Create a `tests` folder (remember the `__init__.py` file)
- Write a simple (passing) test
- Run the tests and check that all pass

## Exercise 2: Play Around with Sqlite

- Go to [https://www.sqlite.org/index.html](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- Download and install sqlite3
- Read the documentation to find out how you can use sqlite3 from python (maybe check also [https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
- Activate `.venv`
- Install `sqlite3` python library
- Create a database `exercise.01.db` inside the `exercise.01` folder
- Write a test that check the database file exists
- Write a test that connect to the database and lists the tables inside it
- *Manually* create a new table called `Test` with attributes `Id` integer, `Desc` String/Text
- Run the test and check that the Test table exists

## Exercise 3: Modeling an Application Domain

Select an application domain and identify possible entities, their attributes, and relationship among them

Example: 

Domain: Education and Class Attendance

Entities: Students, Courses, Sessions

Relationships:
    
- Students attend a session (on a date) of a course
- Courses are made of sessions
    

Other possible application domains to model:

- Scientific Conference Publishing (a paper is authored by many authors and published at a conference, a paper cites other papers, other papers cite this paper)

- Music
- Library
- Health
- Insurance
